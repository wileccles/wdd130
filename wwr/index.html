    <p>Hi everyone! I'm William Eccles, I'm a computer science major, and I'm currently in Idaho but I'm originally from California.
        <p> I love anything relating to video games or anime, I'm a huge nerd when it comes to that stuff since I was practically raised on it.</p>
            <p> I also have a passion for music production, and it's something I hope to get better at over time!</p>
                <p> One last thing is I actually used to have a pet tortoise, but she grew so big that we had to give her away when we moved. Honestly I'll probably try to visit her again at some point because those things have an 80 to 150 year life expectancy, so I have plenty of time to do so lol.</p>
